# Changelog

What each release of tehas changes, and what an adopter must do after
updating to it. Newest first. A release's section is `## vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)`
with `### Changes` and `### Adopter action`; "None." is a valid action.
`scripts/tag-release.sh` refuses to tag without an Adopter action, and the
release workflow takes the release's page from its section
(`scripts/release-notes.sh`). Work in progress goes under `## Unreleased`; a
person renames it to the version in the release's pull request.

## Unreleased

### Changes

- tehas is installed from a release: a signed tarball (SHA256 and minisign)
  published on GitHub for each tag, unpacked side by side under
  `~/tehas/versions/<version>` with `~/tehas/current` pointing at one.
- `tehas update` installs releases: `--check` shows the installed and newest
  version and the notes between them, `--to vX.Y.Z` pins or rolls back.
- Each release pins the pi-rukas commit (`PI_RUKAS_FOLLOW=commit:<sha>`) and
  the base image digest it builds the sandbox from, so one version builds the
  same image on every day. An instance may set `PI_RUKAS_FOLLOW` itself.
- One root command prepares a host, `tehas setup` writes the instance, and
  `tehas check-product` and `tehas init-product` check and scaffold the
  product's files.

### Adopter action

- A host installed from a git checkout keeps working from it. To move it to
  releases, follow "Move a checkout host to releases" in the manual
  (`host/docs/host.md`); until then `tehas update` updates the checkout as
  before.
- Read the new settings in `instances/example/` and compare your instance
  with them; `install.sh --check` names any that are missing.
